#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` constants to match the new app description.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create a new file that describes the logo you want to generate.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
